 *Tuesday 6-9pm
 *GENG1003
 *Assignment 1
 *This program will find the single roots of a quadratic equation to be estimated by the Bisection Method.
 *The information will be inputted from a data file which will provide values of the coefficients of the quadratic polynomial
 *which will also estimate the range of values overs which the roots might be found.
